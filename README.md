   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Set `MONGO_URI` to your MongoDB connection string

## Deploying to your domain `ruthwikredd.xyz`
- Point your domain to the server running this Node app (e.g., via Nginx reverse proxy to port 5000)
- Ensure HTTPS via Letâ€™s Encrypt
- Cards will be accessible at `https://ruthwikredd.xyz/{id}`

## Notes
- IDs are generated with `nanoid` to be short and unique
- API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/cards` create a card (JSON body)
  - `GET /api/cards/:id` fetch card by unique ID
- The card page is a client-rendered page (`public/card.html`) which fetches `/api/cards/:id` based on the current path and renders it.
